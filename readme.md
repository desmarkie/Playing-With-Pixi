PLAYING WITH PIXIJS
===================
A bunch of silly toys I've made while playing with PixiJS ( http://www.pixijs.com/ )

I was using coffeescript on a project at work recently and found the combination with grunt was making javascript fun again. I got the urge to start making those little 'things' that were cool back in the day, but set myself a limit of one sprite. This is a collection of those experiments. All very small, simple and quick toys.
