			className:Smoky,
			classId:"Smoky",
			description:"Everyone starts with particles, right? Anyway, I was mucking around with them and liked the sort of smoky, foggy look the sprite had when it was really big.",
			instructions:"Just wiggle your mouse about to disturb the smoke a little."
		},
		{
			className:Trails,
			classId:"Trails",
			description:"Mouse trails are pretty ubiquitous too. This one looked more alive when I was wiggling my mouse, so I've added a heading vector that fluctuates across an angle spread. Smaller sizes work better on smaller screens.",
			instructions:"A simple mouse trail."
		},
		{
			className:Dots,
			classId:"Dots",
			description:"I've always loved LED grids, chuck in some rhythmic patterns and they hypnotise me. I might come back to this and write an image/text parser for it.",
			instructions:"Lots of settings for this one\nHave a play"
		},
		{
			className:Spirals,
			classId:"Spirals",
			description:"Nature is full of Spirals and they're lovely to look at. This one moves between random selections which alters the patterns produced. The strobing effect makes it look more complicated than it is and becomes almost kaleidoscopic. I may have stared at this one for hours.",
			instructions:"It changes automagically, but hitting space will force a new random selection"
		},
		{
			className:SineWave,
			classId:"Sine Wave",
			description:"A lot of the previous experiments used sine values of some sort and they look pretty cool too. This one started out as a plain old sine wave, but I chucked in some rotation after staring at spirals and it makes some equally pleasing patterns when it strobes.",
			instructions:"Play with the settings in this one"
		},
		{
			className:Stacks,
			classId:"Stacks",
			description:"It's sort of like an abacus.",
			instructions:"Just watch it"
